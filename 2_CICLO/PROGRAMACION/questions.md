# UML Diagrams - Questions & Answers

### Use Case Diagrams

1. **What is a use case diagram in UML?**  
   **Answer**: A use case diagram is a type of UML diagram that shows the interactions between users (actors) and the system, highlighting the system's functionality and the actors' roles in using that functionality.

2. **What are the primary components of a use case diagram?**  
   **Answer**: The primary components of a use case diagram include actors, use cases, system boundaries, and relationships (e.g., associations, generalizations, includes, and extends).

3. **Explain the difference between an actor and a use case in a use case diagram.**  
   **Answer**: An **actor** represents an external entity (person, system, or device) that interacts with the system, while a **use case** represents a specific function or behavior that the system performs in response to the actor's interaction.

4. **What is the role of a system boundary in a use case diagram?**  
   **Answer**: The system boundary defines the scope of the system being modeled. It encapsulates the use cases that are part of the system and separates them from external interactions or actors.

5. **What is an "include" relationship between use cases? Provide an example.**  
   **Answer**: An "include" relationship shows that one use case is always invoked as part of another use case. For example, "Login" might be an included use case in "Purchase" (every time a purchase is made, a login is required).

6. **What is an "extend" relationship in a use case diagram? How does it differ from an "include" relationship?**  
   **Answer**: An "extend" relationship shows optional behavior that extends a use case at runtime, based on conditions or events. Unlike "include," which is always executed, "extend" is conditional. For example, "Apply Discount" might extend "Checkout" under certain conditions.

7. **Can an actor be involved in multiple use cases in a use case diagram? Explain with an example.**  
   **Answer**: Yes, an actor can be involved in multiple use cases. For example, a "Customer" actor might interact with "Browse Products," "Add to Cart," and "Checkout."

8. **What is the purpose of a generalization relationship between actors in a use case diagram?**  
   **Answer**: A generalization relationship between actors indicates that one actor is a specialized version of another. For example, "Customer" could be a general actor, and "Guest" could be a specialized actor with limited functionality (e.g., not able to make a purchase).

9. **How do you represent a system in a use case diagram?**  
   **Answer**: A system is typically represented by a rectangle that contains the use cases. The system boundary is drawn around the use cases to indicate what functionality is within the scope of the system.

10. **How do you represent a "communication" relationship between actors and use cases?**  
    **Answer**: A communication relationship is represented by a line (association) connecting an actor to a use case. It shows that the actor can perform or initiate that use case.

### Sequence Diagrams

11. **What is the purpose of a sequence diagram in UML?**  
    **Answer**: A sequence diagram shows how objects or components interact in a sequential manner, focusing on the order of messages exchanged over time.

12. **What are the main components of a sequence diagram?**  
    **Answer**: The main components of a sequence diagram include objects or actors (represented as lifelines), messages (represented by arrows), activation boxes (showing when an object is active), and return messages.

13. **Explain the role of a "lifeline" in a sequence diagram.**  
    **Answer**: A lifeline represents an object or actor in the sequence diagram. It is depicted as a vertical dashed line that indicates the object's existence over time during the interaction.

14. **What does a "message" represent in a sequence diagram? How is it depicted?**  
    **Answer**: A message represents the communication between objects, usually indicating method calls or data exchanges. It is depicted as an arrow pointing from the sender to the receiver along the lifelines.

15. **What is the difference between a synchronous message and an asynchronous message in a sequence diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A synchronous message (solid line with a filled arrowhead) requires the sender to wait for a response before continuing, while an asynchronous message (dashed line with an open arrowhead) does not require the sender to wait.

16. **How do you represent a return message in a sequence diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A return message is depicted as a dashed line with an open arrowhead, going from the receiver back to the sender, indicating the return of control or data.

17. **Explain the concept of activation in a sequence diagram.**  
    **Answer**: Activation represents the period during which an object or actor is performing an action. It is shown as a rectangular bar on the object's lifeline.

18. **What is a combined fragment in a sequence diagram, and when would you use it?**  
    **Answer**: A combined fragment is used to represent control structures, such as loops or conditionals (e.g., `alt`, `opt`, `loop`). It is useful when modeling complex interactions with conditional or repetitive behavior.

19. **How do you represent loops or iterations in a sequence diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A loop is represented using a `loop` combined fragment, which contains the messages that repeat. The loop condition (e.g., "while items remain in cart") is written inside the fragment.

20. **What is the significance of the "alt" combined fragment in a sequence diagram?**  
    **Answer**: The "alt" combined fragment represents alternative paths in the sequence diagram. It is used to model scenarios where only one of the alternatives is executed based on a condition (e.g., "if payment successful, else show error").

### Collaboration Diagrams

21. **What is the main difference between a sequence diagram and a collaboration diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A sequence diagram emphasizes the order of messages over time, while a collaboration diagram emphasizes the relationships between objects and the messages exchanged between them.

22. **Explain the concept of "messages" in a collaboration diagram. How are they represented?**  
    **Answer**: Messages in a collaboration diagram are shown as labeled arrows between objects, representing the communication between them. The sequence of messages is often numbered to indicate their order.

23. **What is a "link" in a collaboration diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A link in a collaboration diagram represents an association between two objects, often depicted as a solid line between them.

24. **How are objects represented in a collaboration diagram?**  
    **Answer**: Objects are represented as rectangles containing the object name and an optional class name. They are arranged in the diagram to reflect their interaction and relationships.

25. **What is the purpose of numbering messages in a collaboration diagram?**  
    **Answer**: Numbering messages in a collaboration diagram helps indicate the order in which the messages are exchanged, providing clarity on the sequence of interactions.

26. **How does the use of a collaboration diagram help in understanding system interactions?**  
    **Answer**: A collaboration diagram provides a visual representation of how objects interact with each other, making it easier to understand the flow of messages and the relationships between system components.

27. **In what scenarios would you prefer a collaboration diagram over a sequence diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A collaboration diagram is preferred when the focus is on the relationships and interactions between objects rather than the sequence of messages over time.

### Class Diagrams

28. **What is a class diagram, and why is it important in UML?**  
    **Answer**: A class diagram is a structural diagram in UML that shows the static structure of a system by representing its classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. It is important because it models the system's data and the structure of objects.

29. **What are the main components of a class diagram?**  
    **Answer**: The main components of a class diagram are classes (represented as rectangles), attributes (listed within the class), methods (listed below the attributes), associations, generalizations, and aggregations or compositions.

30. **What is the difference between a class and an object in a class diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A class represents a blueprint or template for objects, defining attributes and behaviors. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity created from the class.

31. **What is an association in a class diagram? How is it represented?**  
    **Answer**: An association represents a relationship between two classes. It is depicted as a solid line connecting the two classes, often with multiplicity constraints at each end to specify the cardinality.

32. **Explain the difference between an aggregation and a composition relationship in a class diagram.**  
    **Answer**: Aggregation represents a "whole-part" relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole (e.g., a team has players). Composition is a stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist without the whole (e.g., a house has rooms, but rooms cannot exist without a house).

33. **How are inheritance and generalization represented in a class diagram?**  
    **Answer**: Inheritance or generalization is represented by a solid line with a hollow triangle pointing towards the superclass (parent class). It shows that the subclass inherits attributes and methods from the superclass.

34. **What is a multiplicity constraint in a class diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A multiplicity constraint defines how many instances of one class can be associated with instances of another class. It is shown at the ends of associations, using notation like "1", "0..*", or "1..n".

35. **What is a class stereotype, and how is it used in a class diagram?**  
    **Answer**: A class stereotype is a mechanism for extending the UML vocabulary. It provides additional semantics to a class. It is shown in guillemets, e.g., `<<interface>>` for interfaces or `<<entity>>` for entities.

36. **How are methods and attributes represented in a class diagram?**  
    **Answer**: Methods and attributes are listed inside the class rectangle. Attributes appear at the top, and methods (or operations) are listed below them. Attributes are typically shown with their visibility (`+` for public, `-` for private).

37. **What is the role of interfaces in a class diagram, and how are they depicted?**  
    **Answer**: Interfaces define a contract that classes can implement. They are depicted as a class rectangle with the keyword `<<interface>>` above the name, and a class implements an interface by using a dashed line with a hollow triangle pointing to the interface.
